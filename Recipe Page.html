		<p>Coconut jam, also called kaya or srikaya is a spread 
                for food like bread, biscuits and crackers.The main 
                ingredients are usually coconut milk, sugar or palm sugar,
                eggs and pandan(screwpine) leaves. Kaya means rich in Malay                 
                language, it is sweet and has a curd like rich creamy texture 
                just like custard. For this gluten free pandan kaya buns, 
                the main ingredients for fillings are coconut milk, gluten free
                and vegan custard power, pandan(screwpine) leaves, agave syrup,
		gluten free corn (maize) starch and rice milk. For the dough, 
		using gluten free white bread flour (Laucke Easy Bakers) and 
		meals & grains bread flour mix (Laucke Easy Bakers). You can use 
		any gluten free bread flour and add your own meals and grains if 
		you prefer. This gluten free bread dough is a wet dough as it needs
		more liquid than normal gluten bread to turn out light and fluffy after 
		baking in the oven. My recipe is also vegan, dairy free, egg free, nut 
		free and refined sugar free. These buns are also perfect for kids’ lunch boxes. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>

Kaya spread or coconut jam spread is a Peranakan cuisine, a fusion of Malay and Chinese cuisines. There are many different varieties of kaya jam available commercially, they range from Nonya kaya, which is light green in colour with pandan (screwpine) leaves added; Hainanese kaya that is dark brown in colour, due to caramelised palm sugar added and sweetened with honey and kaya that is yellowish in colour, with eggs added as an ingredient. Kaya spread is passionately popular in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. Loved by all ages especially as a spread on toast with some butter or margarine for breakfast or as a snack and perfect with a cup of tea or coffee. The fabulously famous kaya toasts are widely available in cafes, as a street food or or at the night markets.<br><br>

Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) is part of the large palm family (Arecaceae species). The source of the coconut plant has been in disputes for many centuries. But commonly consented that it was first planted in the Indian-Indonesian province and the coconut disseminated by floating in the ocean and carried across the world by the sea tides. Coconut trees are grown in tropical weathers like Asia, Pacific Islands, Latin America and Africa. Coconuts are called cocos by the Spanish voyagers, meaning ‘grinning face’, as the bottom of the coconut has three small eyes that looked like the face of a monkey. Coconut is a one-seeded drupe (fruits like peach, cherry or plum) but often wrongly classified as nuts. Historically, coconut has been used by many as food as well as for medicinal purposes. Coconut is extremely versatile and many parts of the fruit like coconut water, cream, milk, oil, sugar and the flesh are used in cooking, baking, skin care, hair care, cosmetics and for prevention of diseases. Coconut milk is one of a small number of fluids that comprise a great quantity of fiber as it is produced by shredding coconut meat and combining with coconut water. Coconut milk is often seen as a lactose free option for people with lactose intolerance. It is also very well-liked by vegans as coconut milk is a fantastic dairy free base for vegan smoothies, milkshakes, desserts, cakes and curries, etc.<br><br>

Coconut are often regarded as an unhealthy choice as it comprises a substantial quantities of fats, however it is different from nuts, as it contains mainly medium chain saturated fatty acid, specifically lauric acid. This is then transformed by the body into a substantially beneficial compound called monolaurin which has antiviral and antibacterial properties. Nonetheless, coconut milk has a high amount of saturated fatty acids and it should be used in moderation. However, there are numerous health benefits associated with consumption of coconut milk as it is abundant in essential minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc and selenium. It also contains minor amount of B group of vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin C and vitamin E. Health benefits of coconut milk include healthy bones; boost the function of the immune system; protect the body against free radicals; promote transportation of oxygen by red blood cells and aid in the blood clotting process called blood coagulation by platelets.</span>
